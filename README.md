# TheHourglassExperience along with MongoDB connection
-> This is for my web tech assignment for sem 4, had to connect my website to backend using MongoDB.
It still needs quite a lot of refinement, its just a late night ssubmission work, please feel free to make changes if you like!

-> Unfortunately, the node_modules folder was too large to be uploaded on github, to make sure this works, please download express, ejs, mongoose and other modules/packages using npm install <package_name>. Or use npm i, it installs dependencie listed within your package_json. Please be careful while donloading these and refer to videos if needed.
